1. Software engineering, from the perspective of software engineers, refers to the systematic approach of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software 
   applications or systems. It involves applying engineering principles and methodologies to ensure the quality, reliability, and efficiency of software products.


2. The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process followed by software development teams to design, develop, test, and deploy software products. 
   Here are the steps typically involved in SDLC:

   a. *Requirement Analysis:* Gather and document user requirements for the software.
   b. *Design:* Create a detailed design of the software architecture, modules, and components.
   c. *Implementation:* Develop the software code based on the design specifications.
   d. *Testing:* Verify and validate the software to ensure it meets the requirements and is free of defects.
   e. *Deployment:* Release the software for use by end-users.
   f. *Maintenance:* Provide ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software as needed.

3. *Software Engineering:*
	1. *Definition:* Software engineering is a discipline that deals with designing, developing, and maintaining software systems.
	2. *Focus:* It focuses on the systematic approach to building software, including processes, methodologies, tools, and best practices.
	3. *Activities:* Involves requirements analysis, design, coding, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software systems.
	4. *Goal:* Aims to produce high-quality software that meets user needs, is reliable, scalable, maintainable, and cost-effective.
	5. *Scope:* Includes various roles such as software developers, testers, architects, project managers, and quality assurance professionals.

   *Software Engineer:*
	1. *Role:* A software engineer is an individual who applies engineering principles and practices to develop software solutions.
	2. *Responsibilities:* Involves designing software, writing code, testing applications, debugging issues, and collaborating with teams.
	3. *Skills:* Requires technical skills like programming languages, software development tools, problem-solving abilities, and communication skills.
	4. *Expertise:* Can specialize in areas like web development, mobile app development, database management, or systems integration.
	5. *Education:* Typically has a degree in computer science, software engineering, or related fields, along with ongoing learning and skill development.

4. *Waterfall Model:*
   The waterfall model is a sequential software development process that follows a linear and rigid approach. Here are its main phases:
   - *Requirements Gathering:* Collect and document system requirements.
   - *System Design:* Create a detailed system design based on the requirements.
   - *Implementation:* Develop the software based on the design.
   - *Testing:* Verify and validate the software for correctness and quality.
   - *Deployment:* Release the software to users.
   - *Maintenance:* Provide ongoing support and updates.

5. *Validation vs. Verification:*
   - *Validation:* Ensures that the software meets the customer's needs and requirements. It answers the question, "Are we building the right product?"
   - *Verification:* Confirms that the software adheres to its specifications and requirements. It answers the question, "Are we building the product right?"
